## Security and Legal Policy
Last Updated: 05-07-2025

## Patent Protection
The DataSpace technology is the subject of a provisional patent application [APPLICATION NUMBER] filed with [PATENT OFFICE] on [FILING DATE]. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or modification of this technology may constitute patent infringement and may result in legal action.

## Security Framework
DataSpace employs multiple security layers to protect user data and system integrity:

- Sandboxed Execution Environment: All game code executes in isolated environments to prevent unauthorized system access.
- Client-Side Security: Our proprietary DataSpace technology implements client-side validation techniques that protect against common attack vectors.
- Serverless Architecture: By eliminating server dependencies, we eliminate many traditional attack surfaces.
- Access Controls: User-defined permissions control what data is accessible and shareable.

## Data Security
All user data remains on the local device and is never transmitted to external servers without explicit user action. When sharing is initiated by a user, only the specific data selected for sharing is included in the shareable file.

If you discover a security vulnerability:

- Responsible Disclosure: Please report security issues to edan@analyticintelligencesolutions.com rather than creating public issues.
- Disclosure Timeline: We commit to acknowledging receipt of security reports within 48 hours and providing an initial assessment within 5 business days.
